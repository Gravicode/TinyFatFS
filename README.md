# TinyFatFS
Ported version from https://github.com/hbraasch/FatFsFez for TinyCLR2

C# port of FastFs for GHI TinyCLR 2
It uses the SPI hardware. It does not use the CS pin as setup for the SPI driver. it is using a seperate GPIO pin to chip select because the SD card needs more versatile chip select
